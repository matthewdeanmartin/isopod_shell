## Description
Trivial text adventure game to see what app dev in bash would look like with modern programming techniques.


## Goals

- Formatting
- Documentation generation
- Use python and python tooling to fill the gaps in capabilities of bash

Bash can depend on tools or other scripts.

Check everything
```bash
make check
```

Check one thing at a time
```bash

```
